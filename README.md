# ESXi Telegram Bot

A Telegram bot designed to interact with an ESXi server, allowing authorized users to manage virtual machines (VMs) with commands such as listing, starting, stopping, resetting, cloning, deleting, and taking screenshots.

## Features
- **List VMs**: Get a list of all VMs with their current status.
- **Start, Stop, and Reset VMs**: Easily manage VM power states.
- **Clone VM**: Create a new VM by cloning an existing one with dynamic datastore selection.
- **Delete VM**: Unregister and completely remove a VM along with its storage.
- **Take VM Screenshots**: Capture and send screenshots of VMs directly through Telegram.
- **User-based Permission System**: Control access to commands for specific users.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
- A Telegram bot token obtained from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
- ESXi server credentials and user permissions configured.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone 
cd esxi-telegram-bot
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment Variables
Edit the `.env` file in the project:
```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token
ESXI_HOST=your-esxi-host
ESXI_USER=your-esxi-user
ESXI_PASSWORD=your-esxi-password
USER_PERMISSIONS={"XXXXXXXX": ["list", "start", "stop", "reset", "screenshot"]}
```
- Replace `XXXXXXXX` with the actual Telegram user IDs.
- Adjust permissions for each user as needed.


### 5. Build and Run the Container
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Usage
Start interacting with your bot in Telegram and use the following commands:
- `/list` - List all VMs with their status.
- `/start <vm>` - Start a specific VM by name.
- `/stop <vm>` - Stop a specific VM by name.
- `/reset <vm>` - Reset a specific VM by name.
- `/screenshot <vm>` - Take a screenshot of a specific VM.
- `/clone <vm> <new_vm>` - Clone specific VM by name.
- `/delete <vm>` - Destroy and delete a specific VM by name.
- `/help` - Show the list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `/myid` - Get your Telegram user ID (for setup).

## Security Notes
- Ensure the Telegram bot token and ESXi credentials are kept secure.
- Limit bot access to trusted users using the user permission system.

## Troubleshooting
- **Container logs**: Use `docker logs telegram-bot` to check logs.
- **Permissions**: Ensure the ESXi user account has sufficient permissions for VM management tasks.
- **SSL Warnings**: If you encounter SSL warnings, these are disabled in the code for convenience when dealing with self-signed certificates.
